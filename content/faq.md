1. How to request a proposal?

>Accurate information is first needed to develop a accurate proposal.  Send us an email via the [Contact Us](/contact/) link to begin the process.

2. How can I obtain a SEMS Certificate?

>Foremost, being awarded a SEMS Certificate from the COS exhibits your commitment to making extra efforts to further refine and deeply integrate your SEMS program within operations.  A SEMS Certificate is awarded through the verification of corrective action plan implementation and closeout by the ASP performing your SEMS audit.  To best develop an Audit Plan and secure appropriate resources, the decision to seek a SEMS Certificate should be disclosed within the initial proposal. See our SEMS Certificate (see [COS-2-05](https://www.centerforoffshoresafety.org/-/media/COS/COSReboot/2020-140_COS_2_05_1stedition.pdf)),

3. We would like to prep for an audit, can you help?

> In short “yes”, but with specific safeguards in place.  Maintaining the integrity of the audit process is paramount.  Impartiality must be maintained during the audit process.  In order to assist audit preparation or a “soft audit” client information must be strictly guarded to assure no such bias is introduced into the SEMS audit.  To further learn about these safeguards and discuss the potential for assistance in audit preparation, please [contact us](/contact/).
