## Certification Status

Onward Inc.’s auditing services publishes the status of audit services clients’ certificates as per request of Accreditation Body.  Certification status may be considered as current when all criteria are met, suspended whereas the audit certificate is in review for non-conformances related to the relevant management system or suspended in instances of violation to regulatory / management system criteria, violation of certificate mark / logo as described in client contract and/or, the failure to develop and enact identified corrective actions resulting from audit findings.
If client certification status requires downgrading, a notification prior to the action will be given to client with reasoning and supporting evidence.  Within the determined timeframe, the client and Onward Inc. will discuss necessary corrective actions to reestablish certification legitimacy.

## Complaints and Appeals

Onward Inc. continually strives to develop our services and practices.  Complaints regarding current service should be directed to your account manager.  Complaints related to previous services or appeals to audit service judgements may be submitted by contacting services administrator at info@crewonward.com.

### Complaints

Upon receipt of the services complaint, Onward Inc. administrative representative will acknowledge and confirm nature of complaint and initiate investigation process.  If investigation findings conclude actionable results, a corrective action plan will be developed and carried out.  If deemed necessary, client filing complaint will receive a notification of follow-up action plan.

### Appeals

In the event that auditing service client does not agree with audit conclusion, an appeal request may be submitted.  Upon receipt of the appeal request, an administrative representative will acknowledge and confirm basis for appeals request and will then be reviewed by the appeals committee (independent of the initial audit).  A secondary review of an appeals decision may be authorized.  Upon conclusion of appeals review, appellant will be notified in writing of decision.

Requesting or initiating an appeal process will not result in any biased action from Onward Inc. or its subcontractors.  Onward Inc. values feedback from our clients and will handle each with fairness and transparency.
