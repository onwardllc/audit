{{< blog-post-image-and-blurb "/img/growth.jpg" "Nina Spencer has been working with us at Onward since 2013. She has experience working as a SEMS Manager, Operations Manager, Vice President, and now is the President of the company. We asked Nina some questions to get to know her better and to understand Onward from her point of view." >}}

1. **What do you think makes Onward unique?**

>_We have a history of making decisions that are to the benefit of people not just the dollar value. We are a business like all others however we do not sacrifice our core values to profits._

2. **How would you personally describe Onward’s working culture?**

>_Hard working and laid back. We try not to sweat the small stuff._

3. **If you could go back 5 years, what advice would you give yourself about the company?**

>_Go big, then go bigger, set both big and small goals.. I am detail orientated, which is great in auditing but sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees, younger me could have afforded to take more risks in business._

4. **What have you learnt through the last 18 months of business?**

>_Embrace change. When things are going well, and things change, it does not mean it is going to be bad. It takes a lot of practice to be comfortable being uncomfortable but it’s worth it._

5. **Where do you see or hope for Onward to be in 10 years' time?**

>_I believe we will be in multiple more areas of different types of energy. I know our integrity will still be our driving force. Our progression into ISO auditing is one that is for longevity, I believe we will be a strong pillar between energy producers and auditing bodies._

6. **What advice would you give to someone starting out at Onward for the first time?**

>_Welcome! If there is skill you have that is not being utilized in your current position, we love to cross train and develop people, let us know!_

With our new ISO Auditing Certification, we believe it is important to highlight its importance to both our Lead Auditor Nina, and what this means for the company moving forward.

1. **What does this certification mean to you personally?**

>_Personally, it’s one of those proud moments. I have worked for auditing bodies previously, but to be part of a team that has developed into one is like attending a loved one’s graduation. You knew they were going to do it, but it doesn’t make you any less proud._

2. **What does this certification mean for the future of the company?**

>_It is the formal recognition of an area that we have been working in for many years. It is the stamp that allows our customers to get external recognition of something we have been assisting with them for internal progress. It’s one of the many bulbs that is making the future bright at Onward._

3. **What was the process like getting this certification?**

>_Long, hard, and worth it. We have the upmost respect for the Centre of Offshore Safety, they do their role well and we are glad to build on this relationship._

4. **How do you plan to make the most use out of it?**

>_I think it will give us the opportunity to refresh the way that the word “audit” is viewed by some operators. It can have the same connotation as the tax man, but we are confident that we will be seen as adding value._

Our new certification will allow us to embark on a path where we provide verification through competence for our clients and allow them to embark on a journey of continuous improvement. These external audits will give them the opportunity to spot all the gaps and small flaws in their business and through us highlighting them, they will be able to meet and surpass the newest standards and regulations and through that, develop as a business.
